### Spark inspiration and overcome writer's block with the help of AI.

My friend is a reader for a literary magazine and is inundated with submissions that have been obviously written by LLMs. If you prompt your favorite LLM chatbot to write a few short stories it's easy to see why. Their creative writing abilities when given a basic prompt are formulaic and predictable. This app allows the user to craft a direction for the story and prompt engineering behind the scenes allows the LLM to produce more interesting and varied output. Although these stories likely won't make it to the pages of literary magazines any time soon, the goal of this app is to help spark inspiration in aspiring writers who freeze up when faced with a blank white page.
